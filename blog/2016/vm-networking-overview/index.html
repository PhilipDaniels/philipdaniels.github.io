<p>Posts in the Build Book sequence are intended primarily as an aide-mémoire for
myself; a series of steps to go through for a consistent build experience. They
tend to be to the point, prescriptive and tailored for me personally.</p>
<p>In this article I describe the different types of switch available in Hyper-V
and their equivalents in Virtual Box.</p>
<h2 id="further-info">Further Info</h2>
<ul>
<li>The site <a href="http://intronetworks.cs.luc.edu/">http://intronetworks.cs.luc.edu/</a> is an awesome intro to networking.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.aboutdebian.com/network.htm">http://www.aboutdebian.com/network.htm</a> has lots and lots of info from a Debian
perspective.</li>
<li>When it comes to picking a private IP address, you may want to read the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network">Private network</a> article at
Wikipedia.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h2>
<p>Typically when installing a VM we want the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>The machine should be able to access the Internet. Without this, it won&rsquo;t be
possible to install software or have the VM patch itself.</li>
<li>Assign a static IP address, so that the machine can be easily accessed from
both other VMs and the host machine. This should be considered a pre-requisite
for running server software such as nginx, node or hugo.</li>
<li>When installed on my work laptop, the machine should work whether or not I am
at work, and whether or not I am connected to the corporate VPN.</li>
<li>At work, the machine should NOT be visible to machines other than my host
laptop unless I explicitly setup port-forwarding.</li>
</ol>
<p>Points 1-3 are easy. Point 4 I do not believe is easily possible in Hyper-V 2012
because it does not support NAT, therefore I recommend using an <strong>External</strong>
network, which means your IP will be visible to other machines on the local
network. Hyper-V 2016
<a href="http://www.thomasmaurer.ch/2016/05/set-up-a-hyper-v-virtual-switch-using-a-nat-network/">adds a new NAT switch type</a>,
which makes this problem go away. Virtual Box already has support for NAT.</p>
<p><strong>The TL;DR summary</strong> is that VMs at home can be built with <strong>one</strong> network
adapter and DHCP reservation to assign a fixed IP, but VMs at work need to be
built with <strong>two</strong> network adapters and a static IP manually assigned on the
internal network. Before the reasoning for this can be understood, you need to
understand the types of networks available in Hyper-V and Virtual Box.</p>
<p>But your first decision is whether to use Hyper-V or Virtual Box as your
hypervisor.</p>
<h2 id="hyper-v-overview">Hyper-V Overview</h2>
<ul>
<li>Has the advantage of being built-in to Windows</li>
<li>Integration with Linux clients is less than stellar, even with integration
services installed: graphics acceleration does not work which means apps will
run in software rendering mode. However this only affects things such as Linux
mint when accessing the VM &ldquo;directly&rdquo; via its Hyper-V window, normally you would
<a href="https://www.philipdaniels.com/blog/2016/setup-of-ssh/#using-x-from-my-cygwin-setup">tunnel X over SSH</a> so this is not a problem.</li>
<li>There is no &ldquo;seamless&rdquo; mode so graphical apps are trapped within the Hyper-V
window.</li>
<li>There is no such thing as &ldquo;Shared Folders&rdquo;, so to transfer or share files inside
a Linux VM you will have to use scp, sftp, cifs mounts, etc. This is covered in
my <a href="https://www.philipdaniels.com/blog/2016/debian-vm-setup/">setting up a Debian VM</a> guide.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s slightly easier to have VMs start up at boot-time.</li>
<li>RDP/integration with Windows VMs works really well.</li>
<li>Has a tendency to hard-crash my home desktop, though my home server is
rock-solid.</li>
<li>Has the major disadvantage that it does not support NAT, and setting a static
IP on an internal network seems&hellip;odd. Despite trying many setups, I cannot
get it to work correctly at work.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="virtual-box-overview">Virtual Box Overview</h2>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s an extra download, though that is easy via
<a href="https://chocolatey.org/">chocolatey</a>.</li>
<li>Has a seamless mode but support for it is not very good – the X startup
scripts of some distros do not play well with it, nor does it work well with
Windows multi-monitor setups. Virtual Box does support 3D acceleration, and
with guest additions dynamic window resizing will work out-of-the-box with
Mint-Cinnamon.</li>
<li>If you have Hyper-V installed, <a href="http://www.fixedbyvonnie.com/2014/11/virtualbox-showing-32-bit-guest-versions-64-bit-host-os">you will only be able to use 32bit VMs in
Virtual Box</a>.</li>
<li>Supports the concept of &ldquo;Shared Folders&rdquo; which allow file sharing between the
VM and the host.</li>
<li>Open-source and multi-platform, so knowledge of using it can be transferred to
a Linux environment.</li>
<li>Supports NAT, which means that internet connectivity for VMs is simply defined
and works whether I am at home on WiFi, at work and docked or undocked.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hyper-v-or-virtual-box">Hyper-V or Virtual Box?</h2>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> At home, use Hyper-V because it is already installed on my
server and I have access to the router, at work use Virtual Box because its
support of NAT is an overwhelming advantage.</p>
<h2 id="hyper-v-switch-types">Hyper-V Switch Types</h2>
<p>There are three types of switch in Hyper-V (2012 edition). These descriptions
are taken directly from the Hyper-V manager:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>External</strong> Creates a virtual switch that binds to the physical network
adapter so that virtual machines can access a physical network.</li>
<li><strong>Internal</strong> Creates a virtual switch that can be used only by the virtual
machines that run on this physical computer, and between the virtual machines
and the physical computer. An internal virtual switch does not provide
connectivity to a physical network connection.</li>
<li><strong>Private</strong> Creates a virtual switch that can be used only by the virtual
machines that run on this physical computer.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> If you want a VM to be able to access the Internet you must give
the machine a network adapter that is bound to an <strong>External</strong> switch. (That is
not strictly true, an alternative is to give it a NIC that is bound to an
internal or private switch that has a gateway on it. That technique is described
later for completeness, but is not needed to solve the problem statement above).</p>
<p>You setup switches in Hyper-V before creating any VMs. VM host is called
HYPERBOX and has only one physical network adapter, so I end up with a pair like
this:</p>
<p><img src="hyperbox_external_switch.png" alt="Hyperbox External Switch">
<img src="hyperbox_internal_switch.png" alt="Hyperbox Internal Switch"></p>
<p>When you create a switch in Hyper-V it shows up in Control Panel -&gt; Network and
Sharing Center on the host machine. <strong>You can use this to determine the MAC
addresses of the interfaces, if necessary:</strong></p>
<p><img src="hyperbox_nics1.png" alt="The Network Adapters on the Hyper-V host machine">
<img src="hyperbox_nics2.png" alt="The External Switch in Control Panel">
<img src="hyperbox_nics3.png" alt="The Internal Switch in Control Panel"></p>
<h2 id="virtual-box-switch-types">Virtual Box Switch Types</h2>
<p>Virtual Box networking is very similar to Hyper-V,
<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html#networkingmodes">but it allows even more flexibility</a>:</p>
<p>The equivalent of a Hyper-V External network is a <strong>Bridged</strong> network.</p>
<p>The equivalent of a Hyper-V Internal network is a <strong>Host-only</strong> network.</p>
<p>The equivalent of a Hyper-V Private network is an <strong>Internal</strong> network.</p>
<p>Virtual Box also has a <strong>NAT</strong> network type; Hyper-V does not have a direct
equivalent in Hyper-V 2012 but will in Hyper-V 2016. NAT ensures that VMs
attached to it are not visible to the outside world (i.e. from off the host)
<strong>so it is preferable to Bridged</strong> if you are using Virtual Box. In fact, it is
the default network type in Virtual Box for that very reason. Otherwise, as far
as the VM itself is concerned, Bridged and NAT both provide Internet
connectivity and should appear identical in function.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> If using Virtual Box, use <strong>NAT</strong> for your &ldquo;External Switch&rdquo; and
<strong>Host-only</strong> for what we called the &ldquo;Internal Switch&rdquo; in the Hyper-V section
above.</p>
<h2 id="vm-setup-at-home-the-simple-way">VM Setup at home, the simple way</h2>
<p>This is how I setup at home.</p>
<p><img src="topology-home-simple.png" alt="Home Network Topology"></p>
<p>This section describes the simplest possible VM setup at home. Note that my router
is currently configured to assign IP addresses in the range 192.168.0.200 to
192.168.0.254. DHCP reservations must be in this range too.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new VM with one <strong>External</strong> network adapter. Specify CPUs etc.</li>
<li>Boot the VM and install the OS. Both
<a href="https://www.philipdaniels.com/blog/2016/windows-vm-setup/">Windows</a> and
<a href="https://www.philipdaniels.com/blog/2016/debian-vm-setup/">Debian</a> will default to
DHCP.</li>
<li>Logon to my router and note the MAC address of the new client.</li>
<li>Annoyingly, my router is a PITA and won&rsquo;t allow you to specify a new DHCP
reservation while a client is connected, so shutdown the VM, add a new
reservation, and boot up the VM again.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, every time the VM boots, it will be assigned the same IP, and you can move
on to <a href="#making-vms-visible-to-other-machines">Making VMs visible to other machines</a>.
The list of DHCP reservations can be pasted into <code>/etc/hosts</code>.</p>
<h2 id="vm-setup-at-work">VM Setup at work</h2>
<p>At work we have an NTLM authenticating proxy which &ldquo;caches&rdquo; your IP and Active
Directory credentials. If it gets a non-NTLM request from an IP it knows about,
it considers you authenticated. The upshot is, if you open a browser window the
proxy will, from that point in time, consider you authenticated, so you don&rsquo;t
have to do anything special such as using
<a href="http://cntlm.sourceforge.net/">cntlm</a>.</p>
<p>Uninstall Hyper-V if it is installed then install Virtual Box.</p>
<p>We are going to build this:</p>
<p><img src="topology-work-simple.png" alt="Work Network Topology"></p>
<p>This all seems to work fine as long as addresses in the range 192.168.56.* don&rsquo;t
clash with anything else on my network. (They don&rsquo;t, AFAIK. I am not sure how
Virtual Box chooses that number).</p>
<p>Create a new VM in Virtual Box. It needs two network adapters, the first should
be NAT and the second a Host Only adapter. Create them in that order (1 = NAT, 2
= Host Only):</p>
<p><img src="vbox-nic1.png" alt="NAT NIC in Virtual Box">
<img src="vbox-nic2.png" alt="Host Only NIC in Virtual Box"></p>
<p>When you run through a Debian install, you will be prompted to pick a primary
network card: pick the first one, which will be the NAT one. You will then have
to setup the second one manually in <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code>. Given the
host-only network adapter has the default IP and netmask:</p>
<p><img src="vbox-host-only-ip.png" alt="Host Only IP"></p>
<p>Then my <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code> looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*

# The loopback network interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# The primary network interface (setup by the Debian installer, this
# is connected to the NAT NIC).
allow-hotplug enp0s3
iface enp0s3 inet dhcp

# The stanza below I added manually as a post-installation step.
# It configures the 2nd NIC, for the host-only network, to have a static
# IP address of 192.168.56.101.
auto enp0s8
iface enp0s8 inet static
    address 192.168.56.101
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    network 192.168.56.0
    broadcast 192.168.56.255
</code></pre>
<h3 id="getting-through-the-proxy-when-setting-up-package-manager">Getting through the proxy when setting up Package Manager</h3>
<p>When configuring the package manager, if you are having trouble getting through
the proxy (notwithstanding the note above about how it is supposed to cache
things), you can enter a proxy of the form:</p>
<pre><code>http://pdaniels:pwd@the.corp.proxy.net:1234
</code></pre>
<p>The precise text is in my password vault.</p>
<h2 id="making-vms-visible-to-other-machines">Making VMs visible to other machines</h2>
<p>DNS is the service used to translate machine names to IP addresses. At home, my
router is not capable of running a DNS server - n.b. DHCP and DNS are
<strong>completely different</strong>: even though you may have entered a machine name on the
DHCP reservation page, that is just for human consumption, it does not form part
of the DHCP protocol at all. The DHCP protocal just deals with MAC-to-IP mapping
when reserving names.</p>
<p>And at work I do not have admin access to the DNS services (obviously).</p>
<h3 id="simple-edit-the-hosts-file">Simple: Edit the hosts file</h3>
<p>Because all machines have static IPs it is easy enough to add them into the
<a href="http://linux.die.net/man/5/hosts">/etc/hosts</a> file on Linux. The equivalent on
Windows is <code>C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts</code>. The format of each line is
identical on both operating systems (names are not case-sensitive):</p>
<pre><code>192.168.0.200 hyperbox
192.168.0.201 seedbox
192.168.0.203 samsungtablet mytablet
192.168.0.204 debbox
</code></pre>
<p>On Windows, the <code>/etc/hosts</code> file
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/172218">has priority</a>, so if you give a
VM an IP the same as some other machine on your network, your assignment will
hide the other machine.</p>
<p>On Linux,
<a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/81979/how-does-etc-hosts-match-work">it depends</a>
on <code>/etc/nsswith.conf</code> and <code>/etc/host.conf</code>.</p>
<h3 id="not-so-simple-use-your-own-dns-server">Not-so-simple: Use your own DNS server</h3>
<p>You must somehow get a local DNS server working, so that it is capable of
resolving all hosts on your network and forwarding other requests to your
Internet Provider&rsquo;s DNS servers. Either of the two &ldquo;DD-WRT methods&rdquo; described
below will work, as will running a Virtual Router such as
<a href="https://www.untangle.com/">Untangle</a>.</p>
<h2 id="alternative-vm-setups">Alternative VM setups</h2>
<h3 id="vm-setup-at-home-the-first-dd-wrt-method">VM Setup at home, the first DD-WRT method</h3>
<p>My home router does not do DNS, so machines are only known to each other by IP.
One way to fix this is to run a more comprehensive firmware on the router.
Something like <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/site/index">DD-WRT</a> will allow you to run
both DHCP and DNS on the router, obviating the need to setup <code>/etc/hosts</code> with a
list of IPs.</p>
<p><img src="topology-home-dd-wrt1.png" alt="Home Network Topology - DD-WRT on the router"></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> This is a good solution for running DNS at home, however
installing DD-WRT will invalidate the warranty and might annoy Virgin if you
hose the router&hellip;which I have done in the past.</p>
<h3 id="vm-setup-at-home-the-second-dd-wrt-way">VM Setup at home, the second DD-WRT way</h3>
<p>Change my Virgin SuperHub into modem mode, then insert my Netgear router between
the Virgin SuperHub and the rest of the network, then flash the Netgear with
DD-WRT and proceed. Essentially this puts a new piece of hardware, over which I
have total control, between my network and the Virgin world.</p>
<p><img src="topology-home-dd-wrt2.png" alt="Home Network Topology - DD-WRT on the router"></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> This is a good solution if I want DNS and don&rsquo;t want to wreck
the Virgin box (I will probably be wrecking my Netgear box instead), but I can
cope without it and it will invalidate the Netgear warranty.</p>
<p>Instead of a router, you can use an old PC, as long as it has at least two
network adapters, one to connect to the Virgin modem, and the remainder to
connect all your internal devices (multi-port Ethernet cards are available, or
you could use a hub or switch).</p>
<h3 id="the-linux-software-firewall-alternative">The &ldquo;Linux software firewall&rdquo; alternative</h3>
<p>As an alternative to a hardware solution using DD-WRT, it is possible to run what
is essentially a software router as a VM itself.</p>
<p><img src="topology-home-software-firewall.png" alt="Home Network Topology - software firewall"></p>
<p>In this scenario, we build a VM with two NICs, one we connect to the
<strong>External</strong> switch and one to the <strong>Internal</strong> switch. Then on that VM we
install a Linux distribution that can function, essentially, as a software
router/gateway/firewall with DHCP, DNS and NAT capability. Such distros include
<a href="https://www.untangle.com/">Untangle</a>, <a href="http://www.ipfire.org/">IP-Fire</a> and
<a href="https://www.smoothwall.com/">Smoothwall</a>. Of those 3, I could not get IP-Fire
or Smoothwall to install successfully under Hyper-V, I had numerous problems
getting them to recognise the Hyper-V network cards and/or simply crashing
during installation. Untangle on the other hand installs extremely easily and
has a fantastic web configuration system. On the downside, it needs 2GB of RAM
to function.</p>
<p>Once the firewall is in place, subsequent VMs can be built with a single NIC
connected to the <strong>Internal</strong> network, and configured by DHCP. They will be
assigned an IP address by the firewall (you can reserve them an IP) and the
firewall will also function as a gateway and DNS proxy, giving them access to
the Internet. This technique also has the advantage that the machines are not
visible outside the host (unless you setup port-forwarding). This makes it
useful at work where, at the moment, Hyper-V 2012 does not have NAT.</p>
<p>The downside is the rather large memory footprint (2GB) and CPU overhead of
running Untangle.</p>
<h3 id="the-windows-dns-server-alternative">The &ldquo;Windows DNS server&rdquo; alternative</h3>
<p>Never tried this, but it is available as a role in Windows Server 2012. Dunno
about Windows 10.</p>
