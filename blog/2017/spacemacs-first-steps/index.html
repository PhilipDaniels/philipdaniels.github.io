<h1 id="moving-to-spacemacs">Moving to Spacemacs</h1>

<p>I recently declared, if not
quite <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DotEmacsBankruptcy">.emacs bankruptcy</a>
, then at least Chapter 11 status. After a long time keeping my .emacs as a single
file, I refactored it into a set of self contained lisp files of the form:</p>

<pre><code class="language-lisp">(require 'other-peoples-packages)
...my config...
(provide 'my-package)
</code></pre>

<p>Then I just ensured the director with all these files was on my <code>load-path</code> and simply
<code>require</code>d my own little packages.</p>

<p>This worked very nicely, and seemed to have the side effect of speeding up Emacs
startup. However, I still had quite a way to go to configure a proper
development environment, especially code completion, so I decided to take a look
at <a href="https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs">Spacemacs</a> since it claims to have
such stuff &ldquo;preconfigured, out of the box&rdquo;. Interestingly, it seemed to be using
many of the packages that I was already using in my own configuration, so I
hoped to be able to eliminate some of my own code.</p>

<h1 id="installation">Installation</h1>

<p>To avoid clobbering my existing Emacs configuration I created a new user in
Linux Mint and simply followed the instructions at the Github repo. The first
time that Spacemacs starts you are asked what editing style you prefer - Vim or
Emacs - and it downloads a lot of packages from the Emacs package archives.</p>

<p>I had previously been put off from Spacemacs by the stress that the
documentation places on Evil mode, however I am pleased to report that if you
choose Emacs style editing then, as far as I can tell, it works just like
standard Emacs does - at least if you are used
to <a href="https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm">Helm</a> and <a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra">Hydra</a>.</p>

<h1 id="porting-my-emacs-configuration">Porting my .emacs configuration</h1>

<p>Once I was up and running the process of porting my existing .emacs began. This
was a frustrating process to begin with, it took me a few days to grok what was
really happening. It has to be said that
the <a href="http://spacemacs.org/doc/DOCUMENTATION">documentation</a> is excellent, but
there is a lot to take in at one sitting.</p>

<p>As an experienced Emacs user with a significant amount of configuration to
port, <a href="http://spacemacs.org/doc/DOCUMENTATION#dotfile-configuration">the advice</a>
to put most of your customization in the <code>dotspacemacs/user-config</code> function
doesn&rsquo;t feel like a good move. It could end up being huge and would in fact be a
backward step from my nicely modularized configuration.</p>

<p>The route I quickly decided on was to write my
own <a href="http://spacemacs.org/doc/LAYERS.html#introduction">Spacemacs layer</a>, which
I called simply &ldquo;pd&rdquo;. Layers come with a pre-defined set of files which are
loaded in a specific order:</p>

<ul>
<li>layers.el (declare &ldquo;extra&rdquo; layers)</li>
<li>packages.el (where you configure the packages you are using)</li>
<li>funcs.el (where you declare functions, obviously)</li>
<li>config.el (for your layer&rsquo;s variables)</li>
<li>keybindings.el (general keybindings, not package specific)</li>
</ul>

<p><code>funcs.el</code> and <code>keybindings.el</code> were pretty easy to port. Writing <code>packages.el</code>
was a bit more challenging, one issue that I ran into was that I wanted to use a
function that I had declared in <code>funcs.el</code> as part of my initialization but it
wasn&rsquo;t loaded by then. It would make more sense to me to load <code>funcs.el</code> before
<code>packages.el</code>, but when you start to use a framework like Spacemacs you have to
work within the constraints it sets you. My <code>packages.el</code> has actually ended up
pretty small, it just brings in a few little custom packages that I like to use.</p>

<p>Incidentally, the trick to reusing packages that are not on ELPA - whether they
are yours or anyone else&rsquo;s - is just to create a folder under your layer called
&ldquo;local&rdquo;, for example, under my &ldquo;pd&rdquo; layer I have the <code>buffer-move</code> package
download from the Emacs wiki, and a package of my own containing hydras:</p>

<pre><code>pd\local\buffer-move\buffer-move.el
pd\local\pd-hydra\pd-hydra.el
</code></pre>

<p>I can then initialize them simply within <code>packages.el</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-lisp">(defun pd/init-pd-hydra ()
  (use-package pd-hydra))
</code></pre>

<p>I still have quite a number of settings that are not related to any package in
particular, and these have all ended up in the <code>dotspacemacs/user-config</code>
function. However, since Spacemacs seems so well configured out of the box, it&rsquo;s
a much smaller list than I used to have in my own .emacs configuration.</p>

<h1 id="replacing-hydras">Replacing hydras</h1>

<p>Spacemacs uses <a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra">Hydra</a> to create what it calls
&ldquo;Transient States&rdquo;. One that caught my attention was the &ldquo;Window Manipulation
Transient State&rdquo;. which is bound to <code>SPC w .</code> by default. I had previously
developed my own very similar hydra, though with non-VIM keybindings and some
extra functions, such as the ability to open <code>helm-mini</code>, bring up dired, save
the current buffer etc.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t figure out a way of augmenting a built-in hydra - not really
surprising because the design of them is so intricate, especially if they use a
docstring. So I just copied the built-in one, pasted it into my <code>keybindings.el</code>
and hacked it until I had it just how I wanted it. Then I bound it to the
standard keybinding:</p>

<pre><code class="language-lisp">(spacemacs|define-transient-state pd-window-manipulation
  :title &quot;Phil's Window Manipulation Transient State.&quot;
  :doc (concat &quot;M-arrow = select, M-S-arrow = move, S-arrow = resize. 0-9 = select window N.

</code></pre>

<p>The full thing can be <a href="https://github.com/PhilipDaniels/pd">found here</a>, but be
warned, it is still evolving!</p>

<h1 id="theme-customization">Theme customization</h1>

<p>One of the first things I wanted to change in Spacemacs was the default theme.
Just my luck that my longstanding favourite theme
<a href="https://github.com/sellout/emacs-color-theme-solarized">Sellout&rsquo;s Solarized</a>
uses a non-standard loading mechanism and was a bit tricky to configure.
I <a href="https://www.philipdaniels.com/blog/2017/spacemacs-solarized/">have another post</a>
detailing how to do it.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>After hacking on it on and off for about a week I now have a Spacemacs
configuration that contains everything I deemed really important from my own
config, and in fact the amount of configuration code I need seems to have
diminished quite significantly. I was really surprised how small my
<code>packages.el</code> file had become when I reviewed it for this post.</p>

<p>Sometime in the not too distant future I expect to be moving over to using
Spacemacs rather than my old config. Just need to perfect my hyper key on Linux
first&hellip;I also want to take the opportunity to produce a set of keybindings that
are much more in line with the Windows and Visual Studio defaults.</p>

<p>If you are a new Emacs user or don&rsquo;t have much invested in your <code>.emacs</code>, I
would say it is a no-brainer - you should definitely start with Spacemacs rather
than Emacs. It is just a much better out-of-the-box experience.</p>

<p>If you are an intermediate or advanced user with a lot of configuration
investment, then I would still consider the switch worthwhile, but it will
probably take a little longer to get back to status quo. It would be nice if the
Spacemacs documentation had more guidance for users in this situation.</p>
