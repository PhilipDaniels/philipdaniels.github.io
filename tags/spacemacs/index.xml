      <title>Spacemacs - Configuring the Solarized Theme</title>

      <description>Solarized, tredux There are at least 3 different Solarized theme packages for Emacs:
 BBatsov&amp;rsquo;s Solarized Greg Pfeil&amp;rsquo;s (aka Sellout) Solarized Steve Purcell&amp;rsquo;s (aka SanityInc) Solarized  Steve&amp;rsquo;s is based on Greg&amp;rsquo;s. Of the three, I have always used Greg&amp;rsquo;s in the past, finding it to have a comprehensive set of faces. So naturally I wanted to get it working in Spacemacs. That was a bit trickier than expected, because it uses a non-standard loading mechanism, however, I found an issue on Github that explained how to do it.</description>

      <description>Moving to Spacemacs I recently declared, if not quite .emacs bankruptcy , then at least Chapter 11 status. After a long time keeping my .emacs as a single file, I refactored it into a set of self contained lisp files of the form:
(require &#39;other-peoples-packages) ...my config... (provide &#39;my-package)  Then I just ensured the director with all these files was on my load-path and simply required my own little packages.</description>
