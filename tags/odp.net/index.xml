      <description>Oracle, eh? My new job requires me to deal with Oracle for the first time in anger. I&amp;rsquo;ve found Oracle to be both impressive (PL/SQL is far more powerful than T-SQL) and frustrating. When things go wrong the error messages are often confusing, at best, and at worst positively misleading.
